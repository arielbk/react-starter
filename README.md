# React starter template

Just writing simple notes for now so I know what I've done. I can come back and write more indepth documentation in retrospect.

# React

# Webpack

## Favicons plugin

## Webpack dev server

It will still be necessary to use webpack-dev-middleware to connect to a custom dev server

## Resolver aliases

# ESLint

# Babel

# Styled Components

# Routing
